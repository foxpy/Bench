## How to add your own results

**The most important** benchmarks now only work on Linux

Need to install:
```
cmake
ninja
```

Also you can install:
```
gcc
g++
clang
```

And if you want enable Folly or BoostThread or libc++:
```
folly
boost_thread
libc++
```

If you install all these dependencies, you can run:
```bash
./script/build.sh
./script/run.sh --proc="Your proc name without space"
```
